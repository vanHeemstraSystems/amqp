# Advanced Message Queuing Protocol  (AMQP)

Get to know AMQP, a Message Queuing Platform (aka RabbitMQ and the more performant LavinMQ) that works very well with N8N and Home Assistant.

LavinMQ at https://lavinmq.com/blog/lavinmq-next-gen-message-broker combines the best from RabbitMQ and Kafka with the ease of AMQP and the freedom of re-consuming messages like in Kafka.
